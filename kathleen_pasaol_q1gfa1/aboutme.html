    <hr>
    <br>
    <p> My name is Kathleen Rose Pasaol, I am 14 years old. I was born in November 10, 2008. I am an omnivert, I tend to be extremely extroverted when I am around
        my close friends. I am a fan of horror movies, but I only have chosen friends who are very much willing to watch along with me. I am very easy to 
        talk to despite, the people saying that I look intimidating at first. During the weekends I tend to stay up late, probably because I am playing Valo
        or I'm just advance-studying for a certain subject. Miss ko na po siya. I tend to sing and vibe alone, just me, myself, and I. I also like to read and write
        poems or anything out of the blue, kung trip ko lang po.
